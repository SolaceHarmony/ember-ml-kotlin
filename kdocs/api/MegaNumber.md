# MegaNumber System: Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic for Tensor Operations in EmberML

## 1. Introduction

The MegaNumber system provides a comprehensive framework for arbitrary precision arithmetic in the EmberML Kotlin Multiplatform library. This system serves as the scalar mathematical foundation for tensor operations, enabling precise calculations beyond the limitations of standard numeric types. The implementation is particularly valuable for platforms with Float64 limitations, such as Apple MLX and Metal, where native 64-bit floating-point operations are not supported.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Class Hierarchy

The MegaNumber system employs a modular, interface-based architecture with the following key components:

- **MegaNumber**: Base class providing arbitrary precision arithmetic for both integers and floats
- **MegaFloat**: Specialized subclass for floating-point operations
- **MegaInteger**: Specialized subclass for integer operations
- **MegaBinary**: Specialized subclass for binary data representation and bitwise operations

This hierarchy is complemented by a set of interfaces that define specific operation categories:

- **BasicArithmeticOperations**: Core arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- **FloatSpecificOperations**: Operations specific to floating-point numbers
- **AdvancedMathOperations**: Advanced mathematical functions (square root, etc.)
- **PowerOperations**: Exponentiation operations
- **BitManipulationOperations**: Bit-level manipulations
- **ChunkOperations**: Operations on the internal chunk representation
- **ConversionOperations**: Conversion between different representations

### 2.2 Internal Representation

#### MegaNumber

MegaNumber employs a chunk-based representation with the following properties:

- **mantissa**: IntArray of 32-bit chunks (limbs) storing the significant digits
- **exponent**: Another MegaNumber representing the binary exponent
- **negative**: Boolean flag indicating the sign
- **isFloat**: Boolean flag indicating whether the number is a float
- **keepLeadingZeros**: Boolean flag controlling normalization behavior

The number is conceptually represented as: $mantissa \times 2^{exponent}$, with the sign determined by the negative flag.

#### MegaBinary

MegaBinary extends MegaNumber with additional properties:

- **byteData**: ByteArray representation of the binary data
- **bitLength**: Length of the binary representation in bits

### 2.3 Implementation Pattern

The system uses the delegation pattern to achieve modularity and maintainability:

```
class MegaNumber(
    // Properties
    var mantissa: IntArray,
    var exponent: MegaNumber,
    var negative: Boolean,
    var isFloat: Boolean,
    val keepLeadingZeros: Boolean,
    
    // Implementation classes
    private val arithmeticCalculator: BasicArithmeticOperations = DefaultArithmeticCalculator(this),
    private val floatOperations: FloatSpecificOperations = DefaultFloatOperations(this),
    private val advancedMathOperations: AdvancedMathOperations = DefaultAdvancedMathOperations(this),
    private val conversionOperations: ConversionOperations = DefaultConversionOperations(this),
    private val powerOperations: PowerOperations = DefaultPowerOperations(this)
) : BasicArithmeticOperations by arithmeticCalculator,
    FloatSpecificOperations by floatOperations,
    AdvancedMathOperations by advancedMathOperations,
    ConversionOperations by conversionOperations,
    PowerOperations by powerOperations
```

This pattern separates concerns, improves testability, and enhances maintainability.

## 3. Algorithmic Foundations

### 3.1 Multiplication Algorithms

MegaNumber implements three multiplication algorithms with different asymptotic complexities:

1. **Standard Multiplication**: $O(n^2)$ algorithm used for small numbers
2. **Karatsuba Multiplication**: $O(n^{\log_2 3}) \approx O(n^{1.585})$ algorithm for medium-sized numbers
3. **Toom-3 Multiplication**: $O(n^{\log_3 5}) \approx O(n^{1.465})$ algorithm for large numbers

The appropriate algorithm is selected automatically based on the size of the operands, with thresholds defined in MegaNumberConstants:

```kotlin
const val MUL_THRESHOLD_KARATSUBA = 64
const val MUL_THRESHOLD_TOOM = 128
```

### 3.2 Division Algorithm

Division is implemented using chunk-based short division with binary search for the quotient. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Handle special cases (division by zero, division by a larger number)
2. For each chunk in the dividend (from most to least significant):
   a. Shift the remainder left by one chunk
   b. Use binary search to find the largest digit that, when multiplied by the divisor, is less than or equal to the current remainder
   c. Subtract the product from the remainder
   d. Add the digit to the quotient

Special optimizations are included for division by powers of two, which can be implemented efficiently using bit shifts.

### 3.3 Square Root Algorithm

Square root is implemented using binary search for both integer and float values:

1. For integer values:
   a. Use binary search to find the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to the input
   
2. For float values:
   a. Handle the exponent separately to ensure correct results
   b. Adjust the mantissa if the exponent is odd
   c. Compute the square root of the mantissa using binary search
   d. Set the result's exponent to half of the adjusted exponent

### 3.4 Bitwise Operations

MegaBinary provides comprehensive bitwise operations:

- **AND, OR, XOR**: Implemented by aligning operands and applying the operation to each chunk
- **NOT**: Implemented by inverting each bit in the mantissa
- **Shift**: Implemented with both chunk-level and bit-level shifting

## 4. Advanced Features

### 4.1 Pattern Generation

MegaBinary includes methods for generating binary patterns:

- **generateBlockySin**: Creates a blocky sine wave pattern with specified length and half-period
- **createDutyCycle**: Creates a binary pattern with specified duty cycle
- **interfere**: Combines multiple binary patterns using specified interference mode (XOR, AND, OR)

These pattern generation capabilities are particularly useful for signal processing and waveform generation applications.

### 4.2 Precision Control

MegaNumber includes precision control to prevent excessive memory usage:

- Maximum precision in bits can be configured via MegaNumberConstants.maxPrecisionBits
- Operations that would exceed this limit throw an IllegalStateException

### 4.3 Normalization

Both classes implement normalization to ensure consistent representation:

- Removing trailing zeros from the mantissa
- Handling zero sign (always positive)
- Maintaining leading zeros when requested

## 5. Performance Considerations

### 5.1 Algorithm Selection

For multiplication of large numbers, the library automatically selects the most efficient algorithm based on operand size:

- Standard multiplication for small numbers (< 64 chunks)
- Karatsuba multiplication for medium-sized numbers (64-128 chunks)
- Toom-3 multiplication for large numbers (> 128 chunks)

### 5.2 Optimizations

Several optimizations are employed to improve performance:

- Division by powers of two is optimized using bit shifts
- Normalization is performed after operations to maintain efficiency
- The chunk-based representation allows efficient bitwise operations
- Special cases (zero, one, powers of two) are handled with optimized code paths

## 6. Usage Examples

val sum = a.add(b)
val product = a.mul(b)
val quotient = a.divide(b)
val root = a.sqrt()

// Convert to string
println(sum.toDecimalString())
```

println(power.toDecimalString())
```

### 6.3 Binary Operations

val xor = a.bitwiseXor(b)
val not = a.bitwiseNot()

// Shift operations

// Generate patterns
val sineWave = MegaBinary.generateBlockySin(MegaBinary("16"), MegaBinary("4"))
val dutyCycle = MegaBinary.createDutyCycle(MegaBinary("8"), MegaBinary("3"))

// Combine patterns
val combined = MegaBinary.interfere(listOf(a, b), InterferenceMode.XOR)
```
