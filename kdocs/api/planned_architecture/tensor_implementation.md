# Tensor Implementation Using Bitwise Operations

## Overview

Ember ML Kotlin implements tensors using a novel approach based on bitwise operations. This approach is particularly important for handling Float64 limitations in platforms like Apple MLX and Metal, which don't natively support 64-bit floating-point operations. By implementing high-precision operations using bitwise manipulations, we can achieve Float64-like precision even on platforms with these limitations.

## Core Components

The tensor implementation is built on several key components:

### 1. Bitwise Operations

The foundation of our tensor implementation is a set of low-level bitwise operations:

#### Shift Operations
- `leftShift`: Shift bits to the left
- `rightShift`: Shift bits to the right
- `rotateLeft`: Rotate bits to the left
- `rotateRight`: Rotate bits to the right

#### Bit Operations
- `getBit`: Get the value of a specific bit
- `setBit`: Set the value of a specific bit
- `clearBit`: Clear a specific bit
- `toggleBit`: Toggle a specific bit
- `countBits`: Count the number of set bits

#### Basic Operations
- `bitwiseAnd`: Bitwise AND operation
- `bitwiseOr`: Bitwise OR operation
- `bitwiseXor`: Bitwise XOR operation
- `bitwiseNot`: Bitwise NOT operation

#### Wave Operations
- `interfere`: Combine multiple waves using bitwise operations
- `generateBlockySin`: Generate a blocky sine wave pattern
- `createDutyCycle`: Create a binary pattern with a specified duty cycle
- `propagate`: Propagate a wave by shifting it

### 2. MegaBinary and MegaNumber

Building on these bitwise operations, we implement two key classes:

#### MegaNumber

`MegaNumber` is a base class that provides arbitrary-precision numeric operations:

```kotlin
class MegaNumber(val chunks: IntArray, val isNegative: Boolean = false) {
    // Arithmetic operations
    fun add(other: MegaNumber): MegaNumber
    fun subtract(other: MegaNumber): MegaNumber
    fun multiply(other: MegaNumber): MegaNumber
    fun divide(other: MegaNumber): MegaNumber

    // Comparison operations
    fun compareTo(other: MegaNumber): Int
    fun equals(other: MegaNumber): Boolean

    // Conversion operations
    fun toDouble(): Double
    fun toFloat(): Float
    fun toInt(): Int
    fun toLong(): Long

    // String representation
    override fun toString(): String
}
```

#### MegaBinary

`MegaBinary` extends `MegaNumber` to provide binary-specific operations:

```kotlin
class MegaBinary(val bits: IntArray, val preserveLeadingZeros: Boolean = false) : MegaNumber(bits) {
    // Bitwise operations
    fun bitwiseAnd(other: MegaBinary): MegaBinary
    fun bitwiseOr(other: MegaBinary): MegaBinary
    fun bitwiseXor(other: MegaBinary): MegaBinary
    fun bitwiseNot(): MegaBinary

    // Shift operations
    fun shiftLeft(n: Int): MegaBinary
    fun shiftRight(n: Int): MegaBinary
    fun rotateLeft(n: Int): MegaBinary
    fun rotateRight(n: Int): MegaBinary

    // Wave operations
    fun interfere(other: MegaBinary, method: InterferenceMethod): MegaBinary

    companion object {
        // Factory methods
        fun fromString(binaryString: String): MegaBinary
        fun fromInt(value: Int, bits: Int = 32): MegaBinary
        fun fromLong(value: Long, bits: Int = 64): MegaBinary
        fun fromDouble(value: Double): MegaBinary

        // Wave generation
        fun generateBlockySin(length: Int, halfPeriod: Int): MegaBinary
        fun createDutyCycle(length: Int, dutyCycle: Float): MegaBinary
    }
}
```

### 3. Tensor Implementation

Using these components, we implement the `EmberTensor` class:

```kotlin
class EmberTensor(
    val data: Any,
    val shape: EmberShape,
    val dtype: EmberDType,
    val device: String = "cpu",
    val requiresGrad: Boolean = false
) {
    // Basic properties
    val ndim: Int get() = shape.dimensions.size
    val size: Int get() = shape.dimensions.fold(1) { acc, dim -> acc * dim }

    // Tensor operations
    fun cast(dtype: EmberDType): EmberTensor
    fun reshape(newShape: EmberShape): EmberTensor
    fun transpose(vararg dims: Int): EmberTensor

    // Mathematical operations
    operator fun plus(other: EmberTensor): EmberTensor
    operator fun minus(other: EmberTensor): EmberTensor
    operator fun times(other: EmberTensor): EmberTensor
    operator fun div(other: EmberTensor): EmberTensor

    // Advanced operations
    fun matmul(other: EmberTensor): EmberTensor
    fun dot(other: EmberTensor): EmberTensor

    // Indexing and slicing
    operator fun get(vararg indices: Any): EmberTensor
    operator fun set(vararg indices: Any, value: Any)

    // Conversion
    fun toArray(): Array<*>
    fun toList(): List<*>
    fun toFloatArray(): FloatArray
    fun toDoubleArray(): DoubleArray

    // String representation
    override fun toString(): String
}
```

## Float64 Workaround

The key innovation in our tensor implementation is the workaround for Float64 limitations on platforms like Apple MLX and Metal. Here's how it works:

1. **Representation**: Float64 values are represented using the `MegaBinary` class, which stores the bits of the floating-point number in a chunked format.

2. **Operations**: Floating-point operations are implemented using bitwise operations on the `MegaBinary` representation:
   - Addition: Implemented using bitwise operations that follow the IEEE 754 standard
   - Multiplication: Implemented using bitwise operations that simulate the floating-point multiplication algorithm
   - Division: Implemented using bitwise operations that simulate the floating-point division algorithm
   - Other operations: Implemented using similar bitwise approaches

3. **Conversion**: When interacting with the backend, Float64 values are converted to and from the `MegaBinary` representation as needed.

### Example: Float64 Addition

Here's a simplified example of how Float64 addition is implemented using bitwise operations:

```kotlin
fun addFloat64(a: Double, b: Double): Double {
    // Convert to MegaBinary
    val aBinary = MegaBinary.fromDouble(a)
    val bBinary = MegaBinary.fromDouble(b)

    // Extract components
    val aSign = aBinary.getBit(63)
    val aExponent = aBinary.extractBits(52, 11)
    val aFraction = aBinary.extractBits(0, 52)

    val bSign = bBinary.getBit(63)
    val bExponent = bBinary.extractBits(52, 11)
    val bFraction = bBinary.extractBits(0, 52)

    // Implement IEEE 754 addition algorithm using bitwise operations
    // ...

    // Combine components into result
    val resultBinary = MegaBinary.combine(resultSign, resultExponent, resultFraction)

    // Convert back to Double
    return resultBinary.toDouble()
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

To ensure good performance despite the overhead of bitwise operations, we implement several optimizations:

1. **Chunked Storage**: The `MegaBinary` class stores bits in chunks (typically 32-bit integers) to reduce memory overhead and improve cache locality.

2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Operations are evaluated lazily when possible, allowing for operation fusion and eliminating unnecessary intermediate results.

3. **Operation Specialization**: Common operation patterns are recognized and specialized implementations are used.

4. **Native Acceleration**: On platforms that support it, native acceleration is used for bitwise operations.

5. **Parallel Execution**: Bitwise operations are parallelized across multiple cores when beneficial.

## Backend Integration

The tensor implementation integrates with the backend system through a well-defined interface:

```kotlin
interface TensorBackend {
    // Tensor creation
    fun createTensor(data: Any, shape: IntArray, dtype: EmberDType): Any

    // Tensor properties
    fun getTensorShape(tensor: Any): IntArray
    fun getTensorDType(tensor: Any): EmberDType
    fun getTensorDevice(tensor: Any): String

    // Tensor operations
    fun cast(tensor: Any, dtype: EmberDType): Any
    fun reshape(tensor: Any, newShape: IntArray): Any
    fun transpose(tensor: Any, dims: IntArray): Any

    // Mathematical operations
    fun add(a: Any, b: Any): Any
    fun subtract(a: Any, b: Any): Any
    fun multiply(a: Any, b: Any): Any
    fun divide(a: Any, b: Any): Any
    fun matmul(a: Any, b: Any): Any

    // ... other operations
}
```

Each backend implementation provides its own implementation of this interface. For backends that don't natively support Float64, the implementation uses the bitwise operations described above.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how the tensor implementation is used in practice:

```kotlin
// Create tensors
val a = EmberTensor(listOf(1.0, 2.0, 3.0), EmberShape(3), EmberDType.FLOAT64)
val b = EmberTensor(listOf(4.0, 5.0, 6.0), EmberShape(3), EmberDType.FLOAT64)

// Perform operations
val c = a + b  // Uses bitwise operations for Float64 addition
val d = a.matmul(b.reshape(EmberShape(3, 1)))  // Uses bitwise operations for Float64 matrix multiplication

// Convert to native format if needed
val nativeArray = d.toDoubleArray()
```

## Benefits of Bitwise Tensor Implementation

1. **Platform Compatibility**: Works on all platforms, including those with Float64 limitations
2. **Precision**: Provides Float64-like precision even on platforms that don't natively support it
3. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent results across all platforms
4. **Extensibility**: Can be extended to support other data types and operations
5. **Performance**: Optimized for good performance despite the overhead of bitwise operations

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Performance Overhead**: Bitwise operations are generally slower than native floating-point operations
2. **Memory Usage**: The chunked representation may use more memory than native floating-point types
3. **Implementation Complexity**: The bitwise implementation is more complex than using native floating-point types
4. **Numerical Stability**: Care must be taken to ensure numerical stability in the bitwise implementation

## Future Enhancements

1. **SIMD Acceleration**: Use SIMD instructions for bitwise operations when available
2. **Custom Kernels**: Implement custom kernels for common operation patterns
3. **Automatic Fallback**: Automatically fall back to native floating-point operations when available
4. **Precision Control**: Allow users to control the precision-performance tradeoff
5. **Mixed Precision**: Support mixed precision operations for better performance
