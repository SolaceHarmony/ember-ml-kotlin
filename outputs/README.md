# Outputs Directory

This directory contains output files generated by the ember_ml framework, including visualizations, saved models, and other artifacts.

## Structure

- `animations/`: Contains animated visualizations (GIFs, MP4s) of model behavior and training
- `models/`: Contains saved model weights, architectures, and checkpoints
- `plots/`: Contains static visualizations (PNGs, SVGs, PDFs) of results and analyses

## Usage

### Saving Outputs

The ember_ml framework provides utilities for saving outputs to this directory:

```python
from ember_ml.utils.io import save_plot, save_model, save_animation

# Save a plot
save_plot(plt_figure, 'experiment_results', subfolder='comparison')

# Save a model
save_model(model, 'ltc_trained_model', include_optimizer=True)

# Save an animation
save_animation(frames, 'neuron_dynamics', fps=30)
```

### Loading Models

Saved models can be loaded using the model loading utilities:

```python
from ember_ml.utils.io import load_model

# Load a model
model = load_model('outputs/models/ltc_trained_model')
```

### Viewing Outputs

- **Plots**: Open PNG/SVG/PDF files in any image viewer or browser
- **Animations**: Open GIF files in a browser or image viewer, MP4 files in a video player
- **Models**: Load using the ember_ml model loading utilities

## Maintenance

Output files can accumulate over time and consume disk space. Consider periodically archiving or removing outputs that are no longer needed.
