"""Ember ML Test Suite.

Comprehensive testing framework for the Ember ML library, ensuring
backend-agnostic behavior and implementation correctness.

Test Categories:
    Unit Tests:
        - Core operation validations
        - Tensor manipulation checks
        - Backend switching tests
        
    Integration Tests:
        - End-to-end model validation
        - Cross-backend compatibility
        - Memory management verification
        
    Performance Tests:
        - Operation benchmarking
        - Memory usage profiling
        - Backend comparison metrics

All tests maintain strict backend independence through the ops
abstraction layer.
