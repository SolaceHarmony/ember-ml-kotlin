# Quantum-Inspired Wave Processing

This section describes components related to quantum-inspired concepts applied to wave processing within Ember ML.

## Core Concepts

This area explores representing quantum states and applying quantum-like operations (e.g., qubit operations, wave function evolution) within a neural network context, potentially leveraging wave interference and superposition principles.

## Components

### `ember_ml.wave.quantum`

*   **`WaveFunction`**: Represents a quantum wave function.
    *   `__init__(state_vector)`: Initializes with a state vector.
    *   `normalize()`: Normalizes the wave function.
    *   `measure()`: Simulates measurement, collapsing the wave function.
    *   `evolve(hamiltonian, dt)`: Evolves the wave function over time using a Hamiltonian.
*   **`QuantumState`**: Represents a quantum state with qubit operations.
    *   `__init__(num_qubits)`: Initializes a state for a given number of qubits.
    *   `apply_gate(gate, target_qubits)`: Applies a quantum gate to specified qubits.
    *   `measure_qubit(qubit_index)`: Measures a single qubit.
    *   `get_probabilities()`: Calculates measurement probabilities for all states.
*   **`QuantumWave(nn.Module)`**: A neural network module designed for processing quantum wave information.
    *   `__init__(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)`: Initializes the network layers.
    *   `forward(x)`: Processes input `x` through linear layers and activation functions, potentially representing quantum-inspired transformations.
