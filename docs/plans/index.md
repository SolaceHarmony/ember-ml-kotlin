# Ember ML Architecture Planning Documents

This directory contains various planning documents for the Ember ML architecture. These documents outline the design decisions, insights from various sources, and implementation plans for the Ember ML framework.

## Core Architecture Documents

- [**Ember ML Comprehensive Final Architecture**](ember_ml_comprehensive_final_architecture.md): The comprehensive architecture plan for Ember ML, incorporating insights from all sources.
- [**Ember ML Architecture Summary**](ember_ml_architecture_summary.md): A concise summary of the key insights and architecture decisions.
- [**Ember ML Implementation Roadmap**](ember_ml_implementation_roadmap.md): A step-by-step roadmap for implementing the Ember ML architecture.
- [**Architecture Planning Completion**](architecture_planning_completion.md): Summary of what we've accomplished in the architecture planning phase and next steps.

## Insights from Various Sources

- [**FFT Convolution Insights**](fftconv_insights.md): Detailed analysis of the FFT convolution implementation in hyena-dna.
- [**CUDA Kernel Insights**](cuda_kernel_insights.md): Insights from the CUDA kernel implementation in hyena-dna.
- [**Liquid AI Additional Insights**](liquid_ai_additional_insights.md): Additional insights from our interaction with Liquid AI.

## Specific Component Plans

- [**RBM Save/Load Improvement**](rbm_save_load_improvement.md): Plan for improving the save/load functionality for RBM modules.

## Documentation Maintenance

- [**Documentation Cleanup**](documentation_cleanup.md): Plan for cleaning up the documentation to avoid confusion and maintain a clean structure.
- [**Archive Instructions**](archive_instructions.md): Instructions for archiving old documentation files.

## How to Use These Documents

1. Start with the [**Architecture Planning Completion**](architecture_planning_completion.md) to understand what we've accomplished and what the next steps are.
2. Read the [**Ember ML Architecture Summary**](ember_ml_architecture_summary.md) to get a high-level overview of the architecture.
3. Refer to the [**Ember ML Comprehensive Final Architecture**](ember_ml_comprehensive_final_architecture.md) for detailed information about the architecture.
4. Use the [**Ember ML Implementation Roadmap**](ember_ml_implementation_roadmap.md) to guide the implementation process.
5. Consult the insights documents for specific details about various components and techniques.

## Next Steps

1. Review the architecture documents and provide feedback.
2. Implement the documentation cleanup according to the [cleanup plan](documentation_cleanup.md) and [archive instructions](archive_instructions.md).
3. Begin implementation according to the roadmap.
4. Regularly update the planning documents as the implementation progresses.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the Ember ML architecture planning, please follow these steps:

1. Review the existing planning documents to understand the current architecture.
2. Identify areas where you can contribute (e.g., additional insights, implementation details, etc.).
3. Create a new planning document or update an existing one.
4. Submit your changes for review.
