# Architecture Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture of the Ember ML framework, focusing on the cell architecture and wiring architecture design.

## 1. Cell Architecture

The cell architecture in Ember ML defines the structure and behavior of neural network cells, which are the building blocks of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and other sequential models.

### 1.1 Cell Interface

All cells in Ember ML implement a common interface, which includes:

- `__init__`: Initialize the cell with parameters such as units, activation, etc.
- `build`: Build the cell's internal structure
- `call`: Process an input and return an output
- `get_config`: Get the cell's configuration for serialization

### 1.2 Cell Types

Ember ML supports various cell types, including:

- **Basic RNN Cell**: Simple recurrent cell with a single activation function
- **LSTM Cell**: Long Short-Term Memory cell with gates for controlling information flow
- **GRU Cell**: Gated Recurrent Unit cell with simplified gating mechanism
- **LTC Cell**: Liquid Time-Constant cell with adaptive time constants
- **NCP Cell**: Neural Circuit Policy cell with biologically-inspired connectivity

### 1.3 Cell Implementation

Each cell is implemented as a class that inherits from a base cell class and implements the required interface. The implementation includes:

- **State Management**: Handling the cell's internal state
- **Parameter Initialization**: Initializing weights and biases
- **Forward Pass**: Computing the cell's output given an input and state
- **Backward Pass**: Computing gradients for backpropagation

### 1.4 Cell Customization

Cells can be customized through various parameters:

- **Units**: Number of units in the cell
- **Activation**: Activation function for the cell
- **Recurrent Activation**: Activation function for recurrent connections
- **Use Bias**: Whether to include bias terms
- **Kernel Initializer**: Initializer for the input weights
- **Recurrent Initializer**: Initializer for the recurrent weights
- **Bias Initializer**: Initializer for the bias terms

## 2. Wiring Architecture

The wiring architecture in Ember ML defines how cells are connected to form networks, with a focus on biologically-inspired connectivity patterns.

### 2.1 Wiring Interface

All wiring patterns in Ember ML implement a common interface, which includes:

- `__init__`: Initialize the wiring with parameters such as units, sparsity, etc.
- `build`: Build the wiring's internal structure
- `get_config`: Get the wiring's configuration for serialization

### 2.2 Wiring Types

Ember ML supports various wiring types, including:

- **Random Wiring**: Random connectivity with a specified sparsity level
- **Full Wiring**: Full connectivity between all units
- **NCP Wiring**: Neural Circuit Policy wiring with biologically-inspired connectivity
- **Custom Wiring**: User-defined wiring patterns

### 2.3 Wiring Implementation

Each wiring pattern is implemented as a class that inherits from a base wiring class and implements the required interface. The implementation includes:

- **Adjacency Matrix**: Matrix representing connections between units
- **Sensory Adjacency Matrix**: Matrix representing connections from inputs to units
- **Motor Adjacency Matrix**: Matrix representing connections from units to outputs
- **Sparsity Control**: Mechanisms for controlling the sparsity of connections

### 2.4 Wiring Customization

Wiring patterns can be customized through various parameters:

- **Units**: Number of units in the network
- **Input Dimension**: Dimension of the input
- **Output Dimension**: Dimension of the output
- **Sparsity Level**: Level of sparsity in the connections
- **Seed**: Random seed for reproducibility

## 3. Integration with Tensor Operations

The cell and wiring architectures integrate with the tensor operations framework to enable efficient computation and backpropagation.

### 3.1 Tensor Operations in Cells

Cells use tensor operations for:

- **Matrix Multiplication**: Computing weighted sums of inputs and states
- **Element-wise Operations**: Applying activation functions and gates
- **Reshaping and Transposition**: Manipulating tensor shapes for compatibility
- **Concatenation and Splitting**: Combining and separating tensors

### 3.2 Tensor Operations in Wiring

Wiring patterns use tensor operations for:

- **Adjacency Matrix Operations**: Computing connectivity patterns
- **Masking**: Applying masks to enforce sparsity
- **Random Operations**: Generating random connectivity patterns
- **Indexing**: Accessing specific connections

### 3.3 Backend Compatibility

The cell and wiring architectures are designed to be compatible with all supported backends (NumPy, PyTorch, MLX) through the tensor operations abstraction layer.

## 4. Future Directions
