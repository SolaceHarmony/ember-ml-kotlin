# Ember ML Architecture Updates

## Introduction

Based on our exploration of various repositories and architectures, we've identified several key components and approaches that should be incorporated into the Ember ML architecture. This document outlines these updates, focusing particularly on the FFT convolution approach to fast attention from hyena-dna and the Mixture of Experts (MoE) implementation insights from Liquid AI.

## FFT Convolution for Fast Attention

The hyena-dna repository implements a novel approach to fast attention using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) convolution. This approach achieves linear complexity with respect to sequence length, making it more efficient than traditional attention mechanisms for long sequences.

### Implementation in Ember ML

We propose adding an FFT convolution-based sequence mixer to our architecture:

```
ember_ml/nn/layers/sequence_mixing/
├── ...
├── fftconv/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── base.py              # Base FFT convolution class
│   ├── cuda_extension.py    # Python wrapper for CUDA extension
│   └── functional.py        # Functional interface
└── ...
```

The FFT convolution implementation would include:

1. **Python Wrapper**: A Python wrapper around the CUDA implementation that integrates with our tensor abstraction.

2. **Backend-Specific Implementations**: Optimized implementations for different backends (PyTorch, NumPy, MLX).

3. **Configuration Options**: Parameters like FFT size, precision, and activation functions.

### Integration with Blocks

The FFT convolution can be integrated into our block architecture as a sequence-mixing primitive:

```python
class FFTConvBlock(Block):
    """Block using FFT convolution for sequence mixing."""
    
    def __init__(self, d_input, fft_size=1024, head_dim=8, dropout=0.0, **kwargs):
        """Initialize an FFT convolution block."""
        super().__init__(d_input, **kwargs)
        self.fftconv = FFTConv(
            d_input=d_input,
            fft_size=fft_size,
            head_dim=head_dim,
            dropout=dropout
        )
    
    def forward(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Forward pass through the block."""
        # Apply normalization if configured
        if self.norm and self.prenorm:
            x = self.norm(x)
        
        # Apply FFT convolution
        x = self.fftconv(x, **kwargs)
        
        # Apply post-normalization if configured
        if self.norm and not self.prenorm:
            x = self.norm(x)
        
        return x
```

## Mixture of Experts (MoE)

Based on insights from Liquid AI, we've already updated our architecture to include a comprehensive MoE implementation. The key components include:

1. **Expert Networks**: Specialized neural networks for specific subsets of the input space.

2. **Routing Mechanism**: Sigmoid/softmax-based routing to determine which expert processes an input.

3. **Output Combination**: Methods for combining expert outputs (concatenation, weighted sum).

4. **Training Strategies**: Joint training of output layer and dynamic adjustment of routing weights.

### Enhancements to MoE Implementation

We propose the following enhancements to our MoE implementation:

1. **Sparse Routing**: Implement sparse routing where only the top-k experts are activated for each input, reducing computational cost.

2. **Load Balancing**: Add mechanisms to ensure balanced utilization of experts during training.

3. **Expert Specialization Metrics**: Implement metrics to track and visualize expert specialization.

```python
class SparseMoE(nn.Module):
    """Sparse Mixture of Experts implementation."""
    
    def __init__(self, d_input, num_experts, expert_type, k=2, **kwargs):
        """Initialize a sparse MoE with top-k routing."""
        super().__init__()
        self.d_input = d_input
        self.num_experts = num_experts
        self.k = k  # Number of experts to activate per input
        
        # Create experts
        self.experts = nn.ModuleList([
            registry.instantiate(expert_type, d_input=d_input, **kwargs)
            for _ in range(num_experts)
        ])
        
        # Create router
        self.router = TopKRouter(d_input=d_input, num_experts=num_experts, k=k)
        
        # Create combiner
        self.combiner = WeightedSumCombiner(d_input=d_input)
    
    def forward(self, x, **kwargs):
        """Forward pass through the sparse MoE."""
        # Get routing weights and indices
        routing_weights, routing_indices = self.router(x)
        
        # Process input with selected experts
        expert_outputs = []
        for i, idx in enumerate(routing_indices):
            expert_outputs.append(self.experts[idx](x, **kwargs))
        
        # Combine expert outputs
        output = self.combiner(expert_outputs, routing_weights)
        
        return output
```

## Combined Architecture

By incorporating both FFT convolution for fast attention and an enhanced MoE implementation, Ember ML can offer a comprehensive and flexible architecture for a wide range of machine learning tasks.

## Conclusion

By incorporating insights from hyena-dna's FFT convolution approach and enhancing our MoE implementation based on Liquid AI, we can create a more powerful and flexible architecture for Ember ML. These updates will enable efficient processing of long sequences and specialized handling of different parts of the input space, making Ember ML suitable for a wide range of machine learning tasks.
