## Key Features

Ember ML provides:

1. **Backend Abstraction**: Automatically selects the optimal computational backend (MLX, PyTorch, or NumPy)
2. **Neural Network Architectures**: Implementation of cutting-edge neural network architectures like LTC, NCP, and more
3. **Feature Extraction**: Tools for extracting features from large datasets
4. **Hardware Optimization**: Optimized for different hardware platforms (CUDA, Apple Metal, etc.)

## Getting Started

To get started with Ember ML, see the [index.md](index.md) file for an overview of the library and its capabilities.
