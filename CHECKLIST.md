# Ember ML Kotlin Implementation Checklist

## Core Requirements

- [ ] **No JVM. Pure native/common code.**
  - [ ] Remove JVM-specific code from build.gradle.kts
  - [ ] Ensure all code is written for Kotlin Native/Common
  - [ ] Avoid JVM-specific libraries and dependencies
  - [ ] Target native platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)

- [ ] **Actor-based architecture**
  - [ ] Implement 100% actor-based machine learning platform
  - [ ] Use non-blocking IO throughout the codebase
  - [ ] Implement asynchronous communication over Kotlin channels
  - [ ] Design message-passing protocols between actors
  - [ ] Create actor supervision hierarchy

- [ ] **Tensor implementation based on bitwise operations**
  - [ ] Port ember_ml/backend/numpy/bitwise operations to Kotlin
    - [ ] Implement shift_ops.py functionality (left_shift, right_shift, rotate_left, rotate_right)
    - [ ] Implement bit_ops.py functionality
    - [ ] Implement basic_ops.py functionality
    - [ ] Implement wave_ops.py functionality
  - [ ] Port ember_ml/backend/numpy/bizarromath to Kotlin
    - [ ] Implement MegaBinary class from mega_binary.py
    - [ ] Implement MegaNumber class from mega_number.py
  - [ ] Create tensor implementation using these bitwise operations
  - [ ] Ensure Float64 workarounds for Apple MLX/Metal compatibility

## Metal Kernel Integration

- [ ] **Port Metal kernels to Kotlin Native**
  - [ ] Study MLX_Metal_Kernel_Guide.md for implementation details
  - [ ] Implement Metal kernel bindings in Kotlin Native
  - [ ] Port SVD implementation from mlxtests/metal_kernel_method/svd_metal.py
  - [ ] Create abstractions for Metal kernel execution

## Architecture Components

- [ ] **Backend system**
  - [ ] Implement backend registry and selection mechanism
  - [ ] Create backend interfaces for tensor operations
  - [ ] Implement native backend using bitwise operations
  - [ ] Add Metal backend for Apple platforms

- [ ] **Tensor operations**
  - [ ] Implement core tensor operations using bitwise math
  - [ ] Create high-level API for tensor manipulation
  - [ ] Ensure operations are non-blocking and actor-friendly
  - [ ] Implement broadcasting and shape handling

- [ ] **Neural network components**
  - [ ] Implement actor-based neural network layers
  - [ ] Create message-passing protocol for forward/backward passes
  - [ ] Design non-blocking training loops
  - [ ] Implement gradient computation and backpropagation

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with core bitwise operations**
   - Port the bitwise and bizarromath modules first
   - These form the foundation for all tensor operations

2. **Build tensor abstraction layer**
   - Create tensor interfaces and implementations
   - Implement basic tensor operations

3. **Implement actor system**
   - Design actor hierarchy and message protocols
   - Create channel-based communication system

4. **Add Metal kernel integration**
   - Implement Metal kernel bindings
   - Port key algorithms like SVD

5. **Build neural network components**
   - Implement layers, activations, and optimizers
   - Create training utilities

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Unit tests for bitwise operations
- [ ] Integration tests for tensor operations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks comparing to Python implementation
- [ ] Correctness tests against reference implementations

## Documentation

- [x] API documentation for all public interfaces
- [x] Architecture documentation explaining actor system
- [ ] Examples demonstrating usage patterns
- [ ] Performance guidelines and best practices
