# Build System Stability Report

## Issues Found and Solutions

### 1. Default Kotlin Hierarchy Template Warning

**Issue:** The Default Kotlin Hierarchy Template was not applied to the project due to explicit `.dependsOn()` edges configured for source sets.

**Solution:** Added `kotlin.mpp.applyDefaultHierarchyTemplate=false` to `gradle.properties` to disable the default template and suppress the warning.

### 2. Compilation Errors in TensorInterface.kt

**Issue:** There were compilation errors in the `TensorInterface.kt` file:
- Unresolved reference 'fold'
- Cannot infer type for parameters
- Unresolved reference 'times' for operator '*'

**Solution:** Modified the implementation to use `shape.dimensions.fold` instead of `shape.fold` and explicitly specified the types for the parameters:
```kotlin
get() = shape.dimensions.fold(1) { acc: Int, dim: Int -> acc * dim }
```

### 3. Xcode Compatibility Warning

**Issue:** Warning about Kotlin-Xcode compatibility, as the selected Xcode version (16.4) is higher than the maximum known to the Kotlin Gradle Plugin.

**Solution:** Added `kotlin.apple.xcodeCompatibility.nowarn=true` to `gradle.properties` to suppress the warning.

### 4. Directory Structure Mismatch

**Issue:** The source directory structure didn't match the configured targets in `build.gradle.kts`. JVM directories existed but the JVM target was removed, and directories for native and JavaScript targets were missing.

**Solution:**
- Created directories for native targets: `src/nativeMain/kotlin` and `src/nativeTest/kotlin`
- Created directories for JavaScript target: `src/jsMain/kotlin` and `src/jsTest/kotlin`
- Removed JVM-specific directories: `src/jvmMain` and `src/jvmTest`

## Current Build System Status

The build system is now stable and correctly configured for the following targets:
- Native targets: linuxX64, macosX64, macosArm64, mingwX64
- JavaScript target: js

All necessary source directories are in place, and the build completes successfully without errors. The warnings have been addressed by adding appropriate configuration to `gradle.properties`.

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Add Platform-Specific Code:** As development progresses, add platform-specific code to the appropriate source directories:
   - `src/nativeMain/kotlin` for code shared across all native platforms
   - `src/jsMain/kotlin` for JavaScript-specific code

2. **Consider Target-Specific Directories:** If needed, create target-specific directories for code that's specific to a particular native platform:
   - `src/linuxX64Main/kotlin`
   - `src/macosX64Main/kotlin`
   - `src/macosArm64Main/kotlin`
   - `src/mingwX64Main/kotlin`

3. **Monitor Dependency Updates:** Keep an eye on the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin updates and adjust the configuration as needed.

4. **Address Deprecation Warnings:** The build shows deprecation warnings that will make the build incompatible with Gradle 9.0. Consider running with `--warning-mode all` to identify and address these warnings.
