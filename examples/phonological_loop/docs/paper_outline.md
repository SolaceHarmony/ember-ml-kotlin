# Phonological Loop Neural Architecture: A Biomimetic Approach to Rapid Signal Classification in Noisy Environments

## Abstract
This paper introduces the Phonological Loop Neural Architecture (PLNA), a novel biomimetic approach to signal classification inspired by human working memory systems. By combining continuous-time dynamics with a specialized memory buffer that implements decay and rehearsal mechanisms, PLNA achieves remarkable classification accuracy on RF modulation signals even in high-noise environments. Most notably, the architecture demonstrates extraordinary learning efficiency, converging to optimal performance within seconds of training time and with minimal data requirements. We present empirical results showing 100% classification accuracy on AM, FM, and noise signals, along with theoretical analysis of the architecture's approximation properties.
