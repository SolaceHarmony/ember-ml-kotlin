# MegaNumber Refactoring Plan

## Current State

The MegaNumber class and its subclasses (MegaFloat, MegaInteger) have been refactored to implement a set of interfaces that define their functionality:

1. **BasicArithmeticOperations**: Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
2. **FloatSpecificOperations**: Operations specific to floating-point numbers
3. **AdvancedMathOperations**: Advanced mathematical operations (sqrt, etc.)
4. **BitManipulationOperations**: Bit manipulation operations
5. **ChunkOperations**: Operations on chunks (the internal representation of numbers)
6. **ConversionOperations**: Conversion operations (to/from decimal string)
7. **PowerOperations**: Power/exponentiation operations (implemented by MegaFloat and MegaInteger)

This interface-based structure provides better organization and documentation of the functionality, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.

## Progress Update

Since the initial refactoring, we've made significant progress:

1. **Implementation Classes Created**:
   - **DefaultChunkOperations**: Implements the ChunkOperations interface, providing concrete implementations for chunk manipulation methods like addChunks, subChunks, mulChunks, and compareAbs.
   - **DefaultBitManipulationOperations**: Implements the BitManipulationOperations interface, providing concrete implementations for bit manipulation methods like shiftLeft, shiftRight, multiplyBy2ToThePower, and divideBy2ToThePower.

2. **ArithmeticUtils Class**:
   - Created a utility class that provides static methods for arithmetic operations.
   - Uses the DefaultChunkOperations and DefaultBitManipulationOperations implementations.
   - Provides implementations for add, subtract, multiply, divide, and other operations.
   - Serves as a stepping stone toward the full delegation pattern, allowing us to move code out of MegaNumber while maintaining functionality.

3. **Tests Passing**:
   - All tests for MegaFloat and MegaInteger are passing, confirming that our refactoring hasn't broken any functionality.

These changes represent significant progress toward our goal of making the MegaNumber implementation more modular and maintainable. The next steps will build on this foundation.

## Future Refactoring Plan

The current refactoring is the first step in a larger plan to make the MegaNumber implementation more modular and maintainable. The next steps in the refactoring process would be:

### 1. Expose Internal Methods

Many of the internal methods in MegaNumber are currently private, which makes it difficult to move the implementation out of the class. The first step would be to expose these methods (either as protected or public) to allow for more flexibility in refactoring.

Key methods to expose:
- `expAsInt()`: Convert exponent to integer
- `chunkDivide()`: Divide chunk arrays
- Various bit manipulation methods

### 2. Create Implementation Classes

Once the internal methods are exposed, create implementation classes for each interface:

- **DefaultArithmeticCalculator**: Implements BasicArithmeticOperations
- **DefaultFloatOperations**: Implements FloatSpecificOperations
- **DefaultAdvancedMathOperations**: Implements AdvancedMathOperations
- **DefaultBitManipulationOperations**: Implements BitManipulationOperations
- **DefaultChunkOperations**: Implements ChunkOperations
- **DefaultConversionOperations**: Implements ConversionOperations
- **DefaultPowerOperations**: Implements PowerOperations

### 3. Update MegaNumber to Use Delegation

Modify MegaNumber to use delegation with the implementation classes:

```
// Example of how MegaNumber could use delegation in the future
class MegaNumber(
    // Properties
    var mantissa: IntArray,
    var exponent: MegaNumber,
    var negative: Boolean,
    var isFloat: Boolean,
    val keepLeadingZeros: Boolean,

    // Implementation classes
    private val arithmeticCalculator: BasicArithmeticOperations = DefaultArithmeticCalculator(),
    private val floatOperations: FloatSpecificOperations = DefaultFloatOperations()
    // Other implementations...
) : BasicArithmeticOperations by arithmeticCalculator,
    FloatSpecificOperations by floatOperations
    // Other interfaces...
```

### 4. Refactor MegaFloat and MegaInteger

Update MegaFloat and MegaInteger to use the same delegation pattern, ensuring they maintain their specific behavior while leveraging the common implementation classes.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Private Methods**: Many of the internal methods in MegaNumber are private, which makes it difficult to move the implementation out of the class without significant changes.

2. **Interdependencies**: The operations in MegaNumber are highly interdependent, making it challenging to separate them cleanly.

3. **State Management**: The implementation classes would need access to the state of MegaNumber (mantissa, exponent, etc.), which could lead to complex parameter passing or require a different design pattern.

4. **Backward Compatibility**: Any refactoring should maintain backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing code.

5. **Performance**: The refactoring should not significantly impact performance, which is critical for mathematical operations.

## Conclusion

The current interface-based structure is a good first step in making the MegaNumber implementation more modular and maintainable. The future refactoring steps outlined above would further improve the code structure, but would require careful planning and implementation to address the challenges and considerations.
