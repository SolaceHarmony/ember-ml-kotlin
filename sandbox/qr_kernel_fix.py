    ## QR Kernel Shared Memory Issues and Fix
    
    ### Issues Identified
    
    1. **Thread ID Indexing Issue**: The kernel uses global thread IDs to index into a shared memory array sized for only 32 threads. For matrices larger than 8x8, this causes out-of-bounds memory access.
    
    2. **Grid Size Issue**: The kernel loops through all threads in the grid to combine limbs, but the shared memory array is sized for only 32 threads. This causes out-of-bounds memory access for matrices larger than 8x8.
    
    3. **SIMD Groups Issue**: The kernel assumes at most 8 SIMD groups, but larger matrices can have many more. This causes out-of-bounds memory access for matrices 64x64 and larger.
    
    ### Fix Approach
    
    1. **Two-Level Reduction**: Use a two-level reduction approach - first within each threadgroup, then across threadgroups.
    
    2. **Local Thread IDs**: Use local thread IDs within each threadgroup instead of global thread IDs.
    
    3. **Atomic Operations**: Use atomic operations to safely combine results from all threads.
    
    4. **Device Memory**: Use device memory (global_limbs) for the final reduction across threadgroups.
    
    5. **Separate Variables**: Replace array elements used for signaling with separate variables.
    
    ### Implementation Details
    
    1. Each thread computes its partial limbs as before.
    
    2. Threads within each threadgroup combine their results using atomic operations on shared memory.
    
    3. The first thread in each threadgroup adds its threadgroup's results to a global accumulator using atomic operations.
    
    4. The first thread in the entire grid processes the final result.
    
    This approach scales to any number of threads and threadgroups, eliminating the shared memory issues.
